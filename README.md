## Design Principles

### Inclusive

Inclusivity and accessibility is the highest priority.

### Purposeful

UIs should consist of purpose-driven elements and components. Experiences are as simple and user-friendly as possible.

### Hierarchy & Space

Typography and UI/page elements & components make use of hierarchy, negative space and padding to help provide the clearest navigability and meaning to users.

### Fun & Delight

While blocGLOBAL always strives to maintain the highest professionalism, we do it with friendly & casual language and enjoyable to use functionality.

### Consistency

Every component derived from combining those defined in this system must align with the above principles. When in doubt, contact the friendly UX team.
